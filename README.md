# webscrapingWithPython

This is a webscraping project. I used python libraries called BeautifulSoup4 and csv.

# How to run:
To run the project, hit python scrape.py in your terminal. The command maybe different based on your OS. Make sure you have python as well as BeautifulSoup4 installed before running.
